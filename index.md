The **Research Data Management Librarian Academy** or **RDMLA** is a group of several university libraries partnering with Elsevier studying the need for a Research Data Management Librarian Academy and providing relevant and timely online RDM training. 

Read about the partnership in the Library Connect article: <i><a href="https://libraryconnect.elsevier.com/articles/exploring-need-research-data-management-librarian-academy">Exploring the need for a research data management librarian academy</a></i>.


## Project Goal

The team has compiled an inventory of existing courses and conducted a needs assessment to identify gaps in current training offerings to identify what librarians and researchers need to contribute to their success related to data management and data science. 

See the '<a href="https://rdmla.github.io/home/about/">Research Data Management Librarian Academy Project Report Survey Results</a>'.

From the needs assessment, work has commenced on developing coursework in the following areas: Navigating Research Data Culture, Establishing and Managing Data Services, Overview of Coding Tools, Overview of Platform Tools, and others. 

The project partners consider the project essential to gain efficiencies, meet growing RDM needs and address the librarian skills gap.
