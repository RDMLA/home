The **Research Data Management Librarian Academy** or **RDMLA** is a group of several university libraries partnering with Elsevier to study the need for a Research Data Management Librarian Academy that could provide online RDM training. 

Read about the partnership in the Library Connect article: <i><a href="https://libraryconnect.elsevier.com/articles/exploring-need-research-data-management-librarian-academy">Exploring the need for a research data management librarian academy</a></i>.


## Project Goal

The team will compile an inventory of existing courses for academic librarians as well as researchers and conduct a needs assessment through interviews, surveys and focus groups to identify gaps in current training offerings and to identify what librarians and researchers need to contribute to their success. 

The project partners consider the project essential to gain efficiencies, meet growing RDM needs and address the librarian skills gap.
