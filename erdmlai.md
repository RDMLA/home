TThe **Research Data Management Librarian Academy (RDMLA)** team is seeking qualified information professionals to submit proposals for the **AI Ethics unit** of our new **“RDMLA: AI for Librarians”** curriculum. This new curriculum will be an addition to our pre-existing RDMLA units. The Ethics unit will address ethical considerations of AI Use in the Library and Information Science setting in general, and in Research Data Management practice in particular. We are looking for experts with research and/or practical experience in this topic. The instructor(s) will develop a unit using video lectures and supplemental materials that will discuss ethical considerations and also provide practical guidelines for responsible and appropriate use of AI in the library setting.

The proposal requirements, submission criteria, and evaluation criteria can be found [[here](survey-documents/RFP_AIEthicsUnit.pdf)] Proposals are due by **April 4th, 2025 5pm EST**. 

Contact Samantha Friedman, RDMLA Project Coordinator, at samantha_friedman@hms.harvard.edu with any questions.
