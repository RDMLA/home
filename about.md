#### - What is the RDMLA?

The Research Data Management Academy (RDMLA) is a global, free online professional development program for librarians, information professionals, or other professionals who work in a research-intensive environment. The curriculum focuses on the knowledge and skills needed to collaborate with researchers and other stakeholders on data management. RDMLA features a unique partnership between a library and information science academic program, six academic health sciences and research libraries, and one publisher. All of the content is hosted on Canvas Network, freely available, and open for reuse under a **CC-BY-SA-NC** license.

#### - What is research data management and why is it important for librarians?

Research data is anything collected or generated in the process of research. And research data management is the management of any data you use or generate during a research project. Research data management (RDM) operates on the intersections of data, information, and library sciences. 
<br>

RDMLA is essential to gain efficiencies, meet growing RDM needs, and address the librarian skills gap. Units are created to address the transparent need librarians, information professionals, and researchers have to equip themselves with tools to be able to know the basic foundations of good data management practices.

#### - How did RDMLA determine librarians RDM training/skill needs?

Between May and September 2018, the RDMLA Survey was distributed to relevant groups via email, a Library Connect blog post, listservs, and word of mouth. The 19 question survey gauged general perceptions, particularly from librarians worldwide, about RDM and RDM training.

#### - What's new for the RDMLA?

***July 2020***: The RDMLA team is very proud to continue growing the course to meet and provide the skills librarians need working in research data management. In Fall 2020, RDMLA will launch two new units – “Data Copyright, Licensing, and Privacy,” lead by RDMLA team alum, Scott Lapinski, and “Delivering Data Management Training: A Guide to DataONE Resources,” instructed by Dr. Amber Budden, Director of Learning and Outreach, National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California, Santa Barbara, and is the culmination of the RDMLA’s new partnership with DataONE.
<br>

In Winter 2020/2021, another new unit, “Data Curation and Archiving,” taught by Dr. Adam Kriesberg, Associate Professor, Simmons University SLIS, will launch as Unit 11. Additionally, in late 2021, RDMLA plans to launch the Traditional Chinese language version of the course, which is being translated by National Taiwan University, in partnership with RDMLA.
